      "With a Curb Alert PRO™ parking sensor, you'll no longer have to worry about damaging your vehicle's front bumper when pulling up to or leaving a curb, or approaching the end of a steep driveway. Using Infrared LED technology, the Curb Alert PRO™ curb sensor will reliably detect when you are getting too close to a curb and warn you with a short series of audible beeps, preventing expensive damage to your vehicle. Curb Alert PRO™ is a patent-pending curb detection device that uses the latest in Infrared LED technology to determine the distance of your vehicle from a curb or other low obstacle. It sends out infrared waves that are analyzed by the system to determine how far your vehicle is from the curb. If it determines that your vehicle is dangerously close to the curb, it alerts you with an audible in-cabin tone to prevent damage to your front bumper, spoiler or valence panel. Housed within a weatherproof case to handle any weather conditions thrown at it. Curb Alert PRO™ is an invaluable and easily installed addition to any vehicle with a low front end, from a sports coupe to a hybrid. No more embarrassing expensive parking lot “accidents”. It's happened to all of us. You pull up too close to a curb and you hear that ominous “SCRAAAAPE”. Sometimes, you'll remember to pull away slowly when you return and avoid further damage. But if you drive a sports car, or sports sedan, or any vehicle with a low front end (even a Prius, for example), you can “hook” your lower fascia and experience one of the worst automotive emotions possible – backing up and having the curb rip your lower valence panel or even your entire fascia from the car! It happens every day, to innocent drivers, which is exactly the core frustration for the Corvette owner and Curb Alert PRO™ inventor who approached us and asked us to help him commercialize his new invention. We thought it was clever, and useful.\n",

Now you can see exactly how close you are to garage walls and curbs, automatically, with no switches to activate. Curb Alert Park View Pro senses the space available and turns on a front camera in addition to providing a quick three-beep audible alert. Parking has never been easier thanks to the Curb Alert Park View PRO, the first and only auto-trigger front camera parking aid system. The Curb Alert Park View PRO builds off the existing patented Curb Alert PRO to become the next evolution in helpful parking aids. This highly reliable and easy to install front camera system will save you thousands of dollars by protecting your vehicle’s front end from accidental parking damage.

      "You pull up too close to a curb and you hear that ominous “SCRAAAAPE”. Sometimes, you'll remember to pull away slowly when you return and avoid further damage. But if you drive a sports car, or sports sedan, or any vehicle with a low front end (even a Prius, for example), you can “hook” your lower fascia and experience one of the worst automotive emotions possible, backing up and having the curb rip your lower valence panel or even your entire fascia from the car! It happens every day to innocent drivers, but now there is a solution. With a Curb Alert™ parking sensor, you'll no longer have to worry about damaging your vehicle's front bumper when pulling up to a curb or approaching the end of a steep driveway. Using Infrared LED technology, the Curb Alert curb sensor will reliably detect when you are getting too close to a curb and warn you with a short series of audible beeps, helping you avoid expensive damage to your vehicle’s front end. Having Curb Alert is like owning an affordable insurance policy on your vehicles front end - one most modern vehicles, the system pays for itself the first time it’s used. The Curb Alert can determine the distance of your vehicle from a curb or other low obstacle. It sends out an infrared beam that is analyzed by the system to determine how far your vehicle is from the approaching object. If it determines that your vehicle is dangerously close to the curb, it alerts you with an audible in-cabin tone to prevent damage to your front bumper, spoiler or valence panel. Housed within a weatherproof case to handle any weather conditions thrown at it. Curb Alert is an invaluable and easily installed addition to any vehicle with a low front end, from sports cars to hybrids.\n",

By adding an air suspension from Air Lift Performance, you can give your vehicle a stance to match its attitude. Our engineers started by giving your Mercedes W212 the maximum drop without sacrificing performance – getting you down 89 Millimeter (3.5 Inch) from stock. But simply getting you low is not enough for Air Lift Performance. Our kits are also about achieving the versatility that the common coilover cannot, eliminating classic lowered-car problems, like bottoming out, with the touch of a button. We pride ourselves on making sure that every W212 kit that we build not only provides a great ride, but also handles the curves like it should. In front, the W212 kit features our double-bellow air springs over monotube, threaded-body struts, which provide a comfortable ride and great body support during cornering or braking. With 30 levels of damping adjustability, the struts allow for a huge range of customization, with the ability to go from super soft up to a stiff performance setup.\n",

      "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class has the executive look and style that absolutely oozes luxury and class. By adding an air suspension from Air Lift Performance, you can give your vehicle a stance to match its attitude. Our engineers started by giving your Mercedes W212 the maximum drop without sacrificing performance – getting you down 89 Millimeter (3.5 Inch) from stock. But simply getting you low is not enough for Air Lift Performance. Our kits are also about achieving the versatility that the common coilover cannot, eliminating classic lowered-car problems, like bottoming out, with the touch of a button. We pride ourselves on making sure that every W212 kit that we build not only provides a great ride, but also handles the curves like it should. In front, the W212 kit features our double-bellow air springs over monotube, threaded-body struts, which provide a comfortable ride and great body support during cornering or braking. With 30 levels of damping adjustability, the struts allow for a huge range of customization, with the ability to go from super soft up to a stiff performance setup.\n",

There is nothing more inconvenient than switching back and forth between a few different ball mounts and trying to remember which mount fits with which trailer. A CURT adjustable ball mount is your multipurpose towing solution. Its key feature is its adjustable design that takes the form of an adjustable channel-style assembly. It uses a series of holes to allow the ball mount platform to be vertically adjusted and allow for significant flexibility in drop and rise. With a variable ball height, it can easily accommodate different coupler heights and multiple trailers.\n",

The pintle hook fits any lunette ring with a 2-1/2 Inch inside eye diameter, and it comes with a safety pin for secure coupling. The heavy-duty towing done with pintle hitches brings with it a certain amount of wear and tear on your towing equipment, and to prepare for this, CURT uses a quality finish on all of our pintle mounts, lunette eyes and combination pintle hitches.

There is nothing more inconvenient than switching back and forth between a few different ball mounts and trying to remember which mount fits with which trailer. A CURT adjustable ball mount is your multipurpose towing solution. Its key feature is its adjustable design that takes the form of an adjustable channel-style assembly. It uses a series of holes to allow the ball mount platform to be vertically adjusted and allow for significant flexibility in drop and rise.

      "Your truck might have the muscle and your hitch might have more capacity than you know what to do with, but what about a ball mount that can keep up. The curt adjustable pintle mount is the ideal heavy duty counterpart to your full size pickup and class 5 trailer hitch. Rather than using a reducer sleeve or hitch adapter to increase the shank size of your 2 Inch mount, this pintle mount features a solid steel shank. It can accept any mounted curt pintle hook or ball and pintle combination, and with its height, it offers up to three height adjustment positions. Not only does the pintle mount accommodate a variety of trailers with different coupler heights, but it also allows for use with the heaviest of loads. Its solid shank gives it the strength to accept a gross trailer weight up to 20,000 Pound. It also features a black carbide powder coat finish to ensure maximum resistance to chipping, scratches and rust. Never let your towing equipment hold you back from the job that needs getting done. Whether you are towing a livestock trailer, flatbed or equipment hauler, Bring It® with a curt adjustable pintle mount.\n",

      "The adjustable channel mount is a highly versatile hitch ball mount option. It features a standard receiver hitch shank, a multi level channel and a standardized trailer ball attachment, allowing you to easily tow various types of trailer without requiring you to keep an arsenal of ball mounts on hand. It also features a highly durable construction built to withstand the elements, and built in anti rattle features for smooth, quiet towing. The ball and pintle combination head of this channel mount offers versatile towing options. It features a standard 2 5/16 Inch diameter trailer ball to fit any 2 5/16 Inch trailer coupler. With its integrated spring loaded arm, the ball pintle combination can also be coupled to a 2 1/2 Inch or 3 Inch lunette ring. In the world of heavy duty towing, harsh conditions and relentless exposure to the elements aren't uncommon. For this reason, the adjustable channel mount is finished with a highly durable carbide black powder coat finish. This helps withstand rain, snow, dirt and road salt, protecting the shank from rust and corrosion. The ball of the pintle hook is given a chrome plated finish for additional rust resistance.\n",

Our pintle hooks are available in a receiver style, to fit a 2 Inch x 2 Inch receiver hitch, or in an adjustable style to mount onto an adjustable mounting plate. This heavy-duty pintle hook features a gross trailer weight capacity of 10,000 Pound and a vertical load capacity of 2,000 Pound. The heavyweight towing done with pintle hitches implies a certain amount of wear and tear on your towing equipment, and to prepare for this, CURT uses a quality finish on all our pintle mounts, lunette eyes and combination pintle hitches.\n",

      "If you own multiple trailers or frequently tow a variety of loads, you know how much time and money are spent tailoring your towing system to each and every individual trailer. There is nothing more inconvenient than switching back and forth between a few different ball mounts and trying to remember which mount fits with which trailer. A CURT adjustable ball mount is your multipurpose towing solution. Its key feature is its adjustable design that takes the form of an adjustable channel-style assembly. It uses a series of holes to allow the ball mount platform to be vertically adjusted and allow for significant flexibility in drop and rise. With a variable ball height, it can easily accommodate different coupler heights and multiple trailers. This pintle hook attachment can be mounted on any CURT adjustable channel mount and couples to a lunette eye or standard trailer coupler (adjustable channel mount not included). It features a 2 Inch diameter trailer ball and offers a gross trailer weight capacity of 10,000 Pounds to accommodate a variety of large trailers.\n",

      "The adjustable channel mount is a highly versatile hitch ball mount option. It features a standard receiver hitch shank, a multi level channel and a standardized trailer ball attachment, allowing you to easily tow various types of trailer without requiring you to keep an arsenal of ball mounts on hand. It also features a highly durable construction built to withstand the elements, and built in anti rattle features for smooth, quiet towing. The ball and pintle combination head of this channel mount offers versatile towing options. It features a standard 2 5/16 Inch diameter trailer ball to fit any 2 5/16 Inch trailer coupler. With its integrated spring loaded arm, the ball pintle combination can also be coupled to a 2 1/2 Inch or 3 Inch lunette ring. In the world of heavy duty towing, harsh conditions and relentless exposure to the elements aren't uncommon. For this reason, the adjustable channel mount is finished with a highly durable carbide black powder coat finish. This helps withstand rain, snow, dirt and road salt, protecting the shank from rust and corrosion. The ball of the pintle hook is given a chrome plated finish for additional rust resistance.\n",

      "An integral part of the 3-1/2 Inch system are the new Radius Arm Drop Down Brackets that are designed to reposition the factory radius arms in the stock position in order to retain correct OEM suspension geometry. When you increase the suspension lift to 3-1/2 Inch, the radius arm angle changes which in turn causes a conflict in spring position as well as axle positioning. The radius arm brackets are a necessary ingredient to achieving the increase in lift while not only maintaining the factory geometry, but also the Factory Ride. Brackets are made from strong steel and utilize the existing radius arm frame pockets. The 1 Inch lower spring spacers are constructed from 6061-T6 billet aluminum and mount between the axle pad and the bottom of the coil spring. This kit is designed specifically to work with trucks that have a upper coil spring spacer.\n",

Like a traditional Heim joint, the Poly Flex joint utilizes a spherical ball captured inside a steel outer shell. Unlike Heim joints, however, Poly Flex Joints encapsulate the spherical ball in a special blend of polyurethane. Housed in a steel outer shell, the joint allows a greater range of movement without binding in its attachment points. Also unlike a Heim, the Poly Flex joint does not make noise over time and is completely rebuildable.\n",
